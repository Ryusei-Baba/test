In recent years, many real-time 3DCG applications have been developed,
but the temperature difference between undergraduate and graduate
students has become a problem. This can cause friction between faculty
and students, which can develop into a serious situation. In this
study, we first explored the causes of these problems and then
identified the causes. Furthermore, by applying the methods of the
"age difference absorption theory" and "rudeness skills," we showed
that the temperature difference could be rapidly converged. The method
was tested in two research projects, and the method was shown to be
effective.
